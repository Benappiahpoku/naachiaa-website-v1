// ===== Performance Optimization Notes =====
/**
 * Performance optimizations for Ghana's network conditions:
 * - Components are loaded synchronously for critical above-fold content
 * - Each component manages its own loading states and error handling
 * - Static data is used where possible to reduce initial load time
 * - Images and assets are optimized for low-bandwidth conditions
 * - Offline-capable features where appropriate
 */

// ===== Accessibility Features =====
/**
 * Homepage accessibility features:
 * - Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
 * - ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
 * - Keyboard navigation support throughout all components
 * - High contrast colors for outdoor visibility (common in Ghana)
 * - Touch-optimized interactions for mobile users (48px minimum targets)
 * - Clear visual focus indicators for keyboard users

 */

// ===== Mobile-First Optimization =====
/**
 * Mobile-first approach considerations:
 * - All components are designed mobile-first with progressive enhancement

 * - Responsive layouts adapt smoothly from mobile (320px) to desktop (1200px+)
 * - Fast loading optimized for 2G/3G networks common in Ghana
